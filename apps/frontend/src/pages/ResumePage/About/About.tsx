      <Paragraph>
        I'm a Neuropsychology master's graduate turned passionate developer. My
        journey led me to School 19 (42 network), renowned for its unique
        teaching program that emphasized engaging projects and a self-directed
        learning model. I've since developped my web programing skills through
        different projects and I am actively looking for opportunities that
        allow me to create reusable, maintainable, and scalable code and
        components as a web developer.
