        <p>
          I'm a belgian young developer looking for great opportunities. I
          quickly managed to acquire solid knowledge in computer science thanks
          to the school 19 (42 network), which proposes an interesting program
          contrasting with traditional teaching. I am now growing my passion
          through different personal projects in different fields, including
          data analysis, video games and web development.
