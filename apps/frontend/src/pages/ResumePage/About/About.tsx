        <p>
          I'm a Neuropsychology master's graduate turned passionate developer.
          My journey led me to School 19 (42 network), renowned for its unique
          teaching program that emphasized engaging projects and a self-directed
          learning model. I've since explored data analysis, video game
          development, and web applications through personal projects. I am
          currently looking for interesting new opportunities to develop my work
          career. I'm a Neuropsychology master's graduate turned passionate
