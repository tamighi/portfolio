      <p>
        I'm a Neuropsychology master's graduate turned passionate developer. My
        journey led me to School 19 (42 network), renowned for its unique
        teaching program that emphasized engaging projects and a self-directed
        learning model. I've since explored data analysis, video game
        development, and web applications through personal projects. I am
        currently looking for interesting new opportunities to develop my work
        career.
